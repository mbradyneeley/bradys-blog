<p>In 2023 I joined Dr. Zhandong Liuâ€™s lab at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Childrenâ€™s Hospital (TCH). Our lab is situated in the Data Center at the Neurological Research Institute at TCH. I am loving my current work on LLM Biomedical Applications and look forward to the journey that lies ahead. Here is a nice photo of our lab that we took as part of the opening. Not pictured, Dr. Zhandong Liu. ðŸ˜‚</p>
