<h3 id="caught-a-largemouth-bass-this-morning-on-a-hopper-dropper-set-up">Caught a largemouth bass this morning on a hopper dropper set up</h3>

<p>The hopper was some weird dry fly with a face and squirrel hair that I got in San Antonio, and the dropper was an olive wolly bugger. The wooly bugger was getting hits left and right and the hopper was a nice indicator. This guy hit the wooly bugger hard and he got hooked in the corner of the mouth. Was pretty excited reeling this guy in. All of the bluegill were just standing by watching, I think this pond gets fished pretty hard. Plus there were ducks dive bombing the whole time we were fishing this morning before work.</p>
