### Fishing a hopper dropper set up in a pond close to home

Catching fish after fish on this same hopper dropper set up. The olive wooley bugger is irresistible to bass and panfish. Fishing downtown surrounded by skyscrapers, felt kind of weird. Don't love having to fish places like this, but love that we can still fish often while finishing school. Amazing what we found in the middle of the city.

The micro bluegill that Margueret caught was definitely one of the highlights. Super pretty fish. Love these small water boys. Caught on a little squirrel hair fly.

A nice largemouth that I caught. Came out of nowhere and hit my fly.

Caught this chunker close by the micro bluegill.

This rascal inhaled my hopper. Caught him near this massive carp/koi that was swimming around sucking in flower blossom petals off the surface. Felt like making a cast to the carp in any of the pools in this area would've been cheating as they obviously wait around for people to feed them.
